# Introducing the MVC Framework

Our MVC Framework provides a robust and flexible solution for building modern web applications. This framework follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates application logic into three interconnected components. This separation helps manage complexity and enhance maintainability.

## Core Features

- **Request and Response Handling**: Captures and manages HTTP requests and constructs and sends HTTP responses, integrating seamlessly with views.
- **Routing**: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate controllers and actions based on defined routes.
- **View Management**: Facilitates rendering views with data, allowing for a clean separation of presentation and logic.
- **File Uploads**: Handles file uploads securely and efficiently.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes PHP Data Objects (PDO) for database interactions, providing a consistent and secure way to handle database operations.
- **SMTP and Email**: Manages SMTP connections for sending emails and integrates with SMTP to provide email sending capabilities.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, supporting authentication and data persistence across requests.
- **Middleware**: Allows for flexible request processing and manipulation before reaching the core application logic.
- **Exception Handling**: Handles cases where requested resources are not found, returning appropriate HTTP status codes.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: The framework is initialized with a configuration array, setting up essential services such as routing, view handling, file uploads, database connections, SMTP configuration, and session management.
2. **Running the Application**: The `run` method starts the application. It resolves the incoming request by matching it to the defined routes. If an error occurs (e.g., route not found), it handles exceptions and provides a suitable response.
3. **Error Handling**:
    - **Database Connection**: Establishes a PDO connection to the database, handling errors gracefully.
    - **SMTP Connection**: Connects to the SMTP server for email operations, ensuring that email-related errors are managed.
